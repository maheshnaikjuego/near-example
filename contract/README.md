# Quickstart

1. Make sure you have installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/) >= 16.
2. Install the [`NEAR CLI`](https://github.com/near/near-cli#setup)

<br />

## 1. Build and Deploy the Contract
You can automatically compile and deploy the contract in the NEAR testnet by running:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

Once finished, check the `neardev/dev-account` file to find the address in which the contract was deployed:

```bash
cat ./neardev/dev-account
# e.g. dev-1659899566943-21539992274727
```


```bash
# Use near-cli to login your NEAR account
near login
```

and then use the logged account to sign the transaction: `--accountId <your-account>`.
